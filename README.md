# JavaScript-Quiz-App
I was given the task of creating a timed, multiple choice quiz.  When completed the app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. The quiz criteria was as follows:

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

## Finshed Product
The complsted project starts with a home page:

Progressing to the quiz itself:

In this quiz there are 4 timed questions.  There is a 60-second clock in wich to omplete the quiz, and each wrong answer deducts 15 seconds from the remaining time.

When all the questions are answered or the clock reaches zero, you are given a chance to record your name and score:

And the home page also has a link to the Top 5 Scores page:
